KickAssist Extension Supporters can now have a custom badge next to their name in chat for all channels they chat in.  
These badges will only be shown to other users who are using the KickAssist Extension.  

### Supporter Badge Preview: <img src="https://github.com/KickAssist/.github/blob/main/resources/KA.gif" alt="Image" width="25" height="25">

If you would like to support the KickAssist Extension and get a custom badge, you can get one by making a $5 donation via my PayPal Link or my Patreon Link. Or you can gift me a sub to a channel I'm active in, if I don't already have a sub. But please, ask me first!
