KickAssist Extension Supporters can now have a custom badge next to their name in chat for all channels they chat in.  
These badges will only be shown to other users who are using the KickAssist Extension.

If you would like to support the KickAssist Extension and get a custom badge, you can get one by making a $5 donation via my PayPal Link or my Patreon Link. Or you can gift me a sub to a channel I'm active in, if I don't already have a sub. But please, ask me first! After you make a donation for the badge, please make sure to message me on Discord with your Kick Channel Name so I can add your badge.
